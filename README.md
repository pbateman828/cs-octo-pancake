* Exercises completed in see sharp

* Palindrome
```
Create a Console app that can identify if
a word is a palindrome (the same
forward and backwards like racecar).
Create an overload method to check an
int to see if it is a palindrome.
```
* Fizzbuzz
```
Create a Console app that prints out Fizz
when a number is divisible by 3, Buzz
when divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz when
divisible by 3 and 5. Create it as simply
as possible, then refactor to only
perform each division once.
```
* Note that Jazz is a bonus for the fizzbuzz exercise.
